# Prediction using Logistic Regression
 Here first i performed an exploratory analysis to understand the dataset better. This included visualizing the distribution of key features, checking for missing values, and identifying any patterns or correlations between variables.Though in this dataset there is no missing value.
Then I utilized the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the likelihood of a person being diabetic based on the features in the dataset.The accuracy is coming out to be 76 % approximately using this algorithm.

Here is the link of the streamlit share where i have hosted it - https://predictusinglogisticregression-98ggdqonkrudtys2rgvnyu.streamlit.app/

## Here is a demonstration of the data analysis part
